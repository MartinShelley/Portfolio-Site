          Ever since I was young, I've always been fascinated by technology. At a young age I remember asking my dad if
          I could help setup the new family computer. From there, my passion for technology grew from taking apart many
          laptops in my teens to building a simple website so that my school friends could play games at the start of
          school (if any of my old school teachers read this.. I'm sorry!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Following University, I began my career in IT Support before transitioning into different roles within the Analytics
          industry, where I gained valuable experience leading projects and developing A/B tests for high-profile clients such as
          Ticketmaster & Carphone Warehouse. When the pandemic hit, I rediscovered my passion for web development and committed to a career transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leveraging my experience in A/B testing & my growing technical skillset, I secured a role as a Front End Developer at The White
          Company. There, I delved into many high impacting projects including the implementation of a 'sticky' add to bag button which resulted in a Â£1.8M annual incremental revenue benefit. However, driven by my eagerness to learn and grow, I sought opportunities to deepen my technical expertise and expand my toolkit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as a Front End Developer at I-Neda, I'm continuing my journey as a developer specialising in Angular & Typescript while actively learning
          Node.js & React in my spare time. I'm eager to further my skills even more, embrace new challenges and tackle exciting new innovative projects on the horizon.
