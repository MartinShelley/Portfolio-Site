        <p>
          Ever since I was young, I've always been facinated by technology. At a
          young age I remember asking my dad if I could help setup the new
          family computer. From there, my passion for technology grew from
          taking apart many laptops in my teens to building a simple website so
          that my school friends could play games at the start of school (if any
          of my old school teachers read this.. Im sorry!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Following University and the early years of my career, I've rekindled
          my love for technology and creating things on the web. More noteably
          in recent years I have led on CRO projects for some big named brands
          such as Carphone Warehouse, RBI (RELX group - previous owners of New
          Scientist Magazine & Farmers Weekly) & The White Company.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I'm looking for my next challenge as a Front-End Developer.</p>
